# nginx-ingress-private

The idea is to automatize the deployment of an internal nginx ingress controller on AKS requesting for variables  like ACR repo, AKS name and RGscript can be modified and use your own as the IP used for internal nginx-ingress is 10.240.0.42

IP can be requested as parameter, let me know if you would like that change...

Validation in names is not yet implemented so make sure you are putting the right one.
